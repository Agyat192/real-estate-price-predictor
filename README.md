This machine learning project using python  give you a complete understanding on how machine learning problems are tackled in real world scenarios. We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its Sudarshana real estate (we took random company name) and apply ML program which created to solve it. 
In this project you will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. 
At the end you present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. You will understand how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
